# cloakwp-js

A JavaScript/NPM package that connects your decoupled React frontend to one or more headless WordPress instances. It provides out-of-the-box solutions to all the things you would otherwise be giving up by choosing headless over the traditional approach, such as draft previews, the WP Admin bar (including user authentication), simple data fetching utilities, incremental static revalidation utilities (enabling content updates to take effect as quickly as server-side rendering, without actually rendering the page on every request), and so on (more details later). It works in tandem with the [CloakWP Plugin](https://github.com/cloak-labs/cloakwp-plugin), installed on your WP instance, to enable an out-of-the-box, harmonious integration.

## Install

```bash
npm install cloakwp
```

Currently in beta. More details and documentation coming soon.
